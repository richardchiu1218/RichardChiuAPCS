        <p>Groom cat regularly; Brushing detaches loose hairs, which prevents shedding and hairballs</p>
        <p>Provide correct water; If a cat is pawing at a bowl or sipping from the sink, it might be a good idea to provide fresh flowing water</p>
        <p>Provide multiple litter boxes; Litter boxes should also always be accessible and comforting for cats</p>
        <p>Regularly clean litter boxes; Cats tend to do their business elsewhere (ex: carpets) if they aren't comfortable using the litter box</p>
        <p>Provide scratching surfaces; Scratching comes naturally to cats and this way the cat will scratch furniture less</p>
        <p>Let the cat explore outside; Make sure that the cat has recognized home as home (usually takes 2 weeks); It's better to let cats out in the moring where there is more visibility</p>
        <p>Reinforce good behavior; Cats are generally intolerant of human punishments, but are more receptive to rewards; iving treats during good behavior is a basic method</p>
        <p>Ignore bad behavior; By withdrawing attention from bad behavior, cats are less likely to continue behavior</p>
        <p>Give alternatives to bad behavior; For example, a cat can be given a scratching surface as an alternative to furniture</p>
